# ðŸ”µ Blu (BLU + BLUx)
Blu tokens (BLU, BLUx) **reward musicians** on cXc.world who receive Ups, and reward role (Artist, Changer, Guardian) actions.

> BLUx, not BLU, will be on cXc.world in Beta. BLU won't be released until users can be human-verified. After that, both will co-exist.

All cXc.world users can earn Blu for qualified actions, including posting original creations, Upping content, moderation, and trading in time-pools.


# Functionality
BLU and BLUx are **burned for Blu Ups**. This form of Ups is recorded separately than Sol Ups, but both are combined to rank charts and determine what music shows up on cXc.world.

# Earning ðŸ”µ Blu
BLU/BLUx is paid (1:1) to creators when they earn an Up. cXc Music (music.cXc.world) uses the **Google account of the Youtube video*** to determine which account to pay. A creator MUST link their Google account to their WAX account on-site to receive this payment, and MUST have a youtube video.

BLU is also given for completing role-specific actions, as described in the [Mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) paper.

\* - *There isn't (currently) a way to link Spotify artist accounts, and SoundCloud authors can change their name, so Youtube is the only option.*

# BLU vs BLUx
BLU and BLUx are both worth 1 Blu Up, but differ recipient's verification requirements.

When an account is paid Blu, they either receive BLU (verified users) or BLUx (non-verified users).

**Difference**
  BLU is considered in the algorithm that distributes PURPLE to Top-Chart musicians from rewards pool, **BLUx is not**.

**Similarity**
  Both are counted in the default chart display shown to listeners on cXc.world

**Converting BLUx to BLU**
  A user that becomes verified can convert (burn + issue) BLUx for BLU up to the amount that they have received in the past according to transaction records.

> BLUx, not BLU, will be the only Blu on cXc.world in Beta.

# Supply of BLU and BLUx
BLU and BLUx have a maximum supply of 2^62-1, the highest possible on EOSIO. Circulating supply fluctuates, with BLUx predicted to have a much higher circulating supply than BLU at all times.

**BLU is indivisible** (0 precision) token, matching it's functionality of being **worth exactly 1 Up.**
