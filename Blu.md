# Blu ($BLU + BLUx)

[$BLU](https://wax.bloks.io/account/blublublublu) is a [WAX](https://wax.io/) token used to **reward musicians** on cXc.world.

All participants in the Purple Positive Attention Economy can earn BLU for qualified actions, including posting original creations, Upping content, moderation, and trading in time-pools.

> Blu or BLU may refer to both $BLUx and $BLU, which are separate tokens with similar functionality

# Functionality
BLU and BLUx are **burned for Blu Ups**. This form of Ups is recorded separately than Sol Ups, but both are combined to rank charts and determine what music shows up on the mapp.

# Earning $BLU
BLU/BLUx is paid (1:1) to creators when they earn an Up. cXc Music (music.cXc.world) uses the **Google account of the Youtube video*** to determine which account to pay. A creator MUST link their Google account to their WAX account on-site to receive this payment, and MUST have a youtube video.

BLU is also given for completing role-specific actions, as described in the [Mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) paper.

\* - *There isn't (currently) a way to link Spotify artist accounts, and SoundCloud authors can change their name, so Youtube is the only option.*

# $BLU vs $BLUx

When a user is paid BLU, they either receive $BLU or $BLUx **depending on if they are verified** (BLU) or not (BLUx)

- $BLU is considered in the algorithm that distributes PURPLE to Top-Chart musicians, **BLUx is not**.

- A user that becomes verified can convert (burn + mint) $BLUx for $BLU up to the amount that they have received in the past according to transaction records.


# Supply of $BLU and $BLUx
$BLU and $BLUx have a maximum supply of 2^62-1, the highest possible on EOSIO. Circulating supply fluctuates, with $BLUx predicted to have a much higher circulating supply than $BLU at all times.

**BLU is indivisible** (0 percision) token, matching it's functionality of being **worth exactly 1 Up.**
