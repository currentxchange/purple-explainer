# ðŸ”µ Blu (BLU + BLUX)
Blu tokens (BLU, BLUX) **reward musicians** on cXc.world who receive Ups, and reward role (Artist, Changer, Guardian) actions.

> BLUX, not BLU, will be on cXc.world in Beta. BLU won't be released until users can be human-verified. After that, both will co-exist.
> UPDATE: Because another project is using the BLUX name, and new mechanics do not require verified accounts, BLUX is the only token planned to be released. Minting of BLUX has been increased to 10,000,000 at a time and can be tracked at the contract address [bluxbluxblux](https://waxblock.io/account/bluxbluxblux). Minting mechanics have not changed, and BLUX is currently being minted obly got [Everstone](Everstones.md) rewards.

All cXc.world users can earn Blu for qualified actions, including posting original creations, Upping content, moderation, and trading in time-pools.

# Functionality
BLU and BLUX are **burned for Blu Ups**. This form of Ups is recorded separately than Sol Ups, but both are combined to rank charts and determine what music shows up on cXc.world.

# Earning ðŸ”µ Blu
BLU/BLUX is paid (1:1) to creators when they earn a Sol Up. cXc Music (music.cXc.world) uses the **Google account of the Youtube video*** to determine which account to pay. A creator MUST link their Google account to their WAX account on-site to receive this payment, and MUST have a youtube video.

BLU is also given for completing role-specific actions, as described in the [Mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) paper.

\* - *There isn't (currently) a way to link Spotify artist accounts, and SoundCloud authors can change their name, so Youtube is the only option.*

# BLU vs BLUX
BLU and BLUX are both worth 1 Blu Up, but differ recipient's verification requirements.

When an account is paid Blu, they either receive BLU (verified users) or BLUX (non-verified users).

**Difference**
  BLU is considered in the algorithm that distributes PURPLE to Top-Chart musicians from rewards pool, **BLUX is not**.

**Similarity**
  Both are counted in the default chart display shown to listeners on cXc.world

**Converting BLUX to BLU**
  A user that becomes verified can convert (burn + issue) BLUX for BLU up to the amount that they have received in the past according to transaction records.

> BLUX, not BLU, will be the only Blu on cXc.world in Beta.

# Supply of BLU and BLUX
BLU and BLUX have a maximum supply of 2<sub>64</sub>-1, the highest possible on EOSIO. Circulating supply fluctuates, with BLUX predicted to have a much higher circulating supply than BLU at all times.

**BLU is indivisible** (0 precision) token, matching it's functionality of being **worth exactly 1 Up.**
