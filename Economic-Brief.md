# 🟣 PURPLE Economic Brief

## Tech
`eosio.token`-based [purplepurple](https://wax.bloks.io/account/purplepurple) on WAX blockchain

## Utility
🟣 PURPLE provides 1 Upvote per day on 1 piece of content when held by an Everstone NFT. Each Everstone can hold 288 PURPLE, equal to 288 daily Ups max. Everstones give content a boost, while also limiting how much influence one PURPLE holder can have on the Top Charts.

PURPLE will be used across all current + future [cXc.world](https://cxc.world) mapps. PURPLE is divisible up to 8 decimal places.

## Max Supply = 35,831,808 (12<sup>7</sup>) 🟣 PURPLE

29,858 🟣 - Founder Pay for 2021  
100,000 🟣 - Team + Dev Pay

# 🔵 BLUx Economic Brief

## Tech
`eosio.token`-based [bluxbluxblux](https://wax.bloks.io/account/bluxbluxblux) contract on WAX blockchain

## Utility
🔵 BLUx is a reward given to creators that receive 1 Up on a piece of content they created. Guardian and Changer roles can also earn BLUx. 

1 BLUx can be spent to make 1 Blu Up. Ups make content appear bigger on the mapp, and higher on the [charts](Top-Charts.md). BLUx is indivisible.

Because SOL is limited, BLUx is the only way to Up a piece of content more than 288 times in one day. 


## Max Supply = Max Possible on EOSIO (2<sup>64</sup>-1) 🔵 BLUx

## Here's exactly how many BLUx have been issued.
1,000,000 🔵 - Promo Budget  
100,000 🔵 - Liquidity pools

We will issue up to 5,500,000 BLUx during the promotion of [cXc.world](https://cxc.world) Beta, 5,000,000 for promotion and 500,000 for liquidity. Also, we may add leftover Promo budget to liquidity pools.

Additionally, 1 BLUx is issued to be paid to artists for each Sol Up they receive  (batch pre-issued 1,000,000 at a time)

# *[1,100,000 Circulating 🔵 BLUx](https://wax.bloks.io/tokens/BLUX-wax-bluxbluxblux)*


**We will not issue any further BLUx until rewards systems are in place.**

# Buy/Sell 🔵 BLUx on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/BLUX-bluxbluxblux_WAX-eosio.token)

# Swap [WAX/BLUX](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=BLUX-bluxbluxblux&input=WAX-eosio.token) + [BLUx/PURPLE](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?input=BLUX-bluxbluxblux&output=PURPLE-purplepurple)
