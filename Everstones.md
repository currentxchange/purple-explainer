# Everstone NFTs
Everstones are 🟣 PURPLE-backed NFTs that send out 🔵 BLUX or Blu Ups daily. One Everstone is backed by between 1-64 PURPLE, and has a daily harvest between 1-432 BLUX or Blu Ups. When an Everstone is destroyed, the PURPLE is sent back to the Everstone's owner.


When you have an Everstone NFT, you get the choice to automatically Up chosen content every day or take a set reward in BLUX everyday. You may switch later. 

> Each Everstone level has art and a name, revealed at a later date

The more PURPLE an Everstone holds, the more efficient it becomes.

## Everstone Rarity
Everstones are released at a slow but steady pace. How we decide to do this, we have not yet determined. Everstones are sold for face value at market sell price of PURPLE. 

## Empowering Creators 👨‍🎤🎤
Everstones are particularly useful for creators, as daily Ups on their content gives them exposure on the map and Top Charts.

## Empowering Fans 🧝‍
Fans may collect BLUX to Up their favorite artist's latest release. This can really help, because local chart topping gives way to bigger connections, new opportunities, and measurable exposure.
