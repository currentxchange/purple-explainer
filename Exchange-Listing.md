# Purple Market Making + Incentives

# Overview
$PURPLE is listed starting **April 17, 2021** on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token) and [Newdex](https://newdex.io) under the WAX markets section. Because of the very limited supply of $PURPLE, ascending price sell orders will be used to ensure that hoarding doesn't happen, so that everyone has a chance to acquire the $PURPLE they need to benefit fully from cXc.world.  

> As $BLU and $BLUx are also eosio.token(s), they can show up on exchanges also, but these markets will not be interacted with by Current X Change LLC

# Digital Advertising's bitcoin
> Why would one want to HODL PURPLE?

Since **PURPLE** can be staked for continual attention to a piece of content, it's a rare form of digital advertising purchase that allows someone to buy once and hold **continual attention** for all of time. This attention means huge value, particularly to independent creators and creative organizations such as record labels and artist collectives.

Furthermore, **PURPLE** need only be unstaked for the holder to receive back the same amount of tokens. This means an artist can advertise their art and meanwhile hold something of increasing utility as each future cXc.world mapp is released.

## Today Musicians, Tomorrow All
$PURPLE has a unique utility for musicians as **cXc Music** is the first [**cXc.world**](https://cxc.world) mapp, but this utility will expand to all creators and creative collectives when **cXc Video**, **cXc Photo**, **cXc Scribe**, **cXc Art** + more mapps are available.  

# First Ascending Sell Orders.
At launch, the first ascending sell order will be placed with pricing from **20 - 240 WAX** per token.
Amount of Tokens Available: 1/12 Max Supply (12^6)


# Second, Third, and Fourth Sell Orders
Once all tokens are sold, another 12^6 batch of sell orders will launch priced at **240 - 2880 WAX** per PURPLE. After that, a third batch will arrive priced **2880 - 34,560 WAX**, and a final sell order at **34,560 - 414,720 WAX**.

> Prices may adjust according to market price of WAX

## Pricing Rationale
It's easy to see that PURPLE's later sell orders go up rapidly in price. This is to ensure:

1. Creators on cXc.world may find easier liquidity by undercutting our market orders.

3. If large players in the music industry see high utility in PURPLE and want to buy as much as they can, they will run into **exponentially scaling economic barriers** after they eat up all the creator's sell orders. This ensures no shadowy interests will get to control what content appears on the map, and if they try, they will simply be paying creators handsomely, whom will likely be able to create better content with their earnings.

> For perspective, the highest price of the final sell order equates to around 33,177 USD at current WAX rates (0.08), which would make the PURPLE market cap almost exactly the current bitcoin market cap at the current price (56,840). So although it seems astronomical, this amount has been proven to be acceptable for market valuation of a cryptocurrency.


# Liquidity Promise
Of the first **1,000,000 WAX** raised by the direct listing of PURPLE, no less than **500,000 WAX** will serve as liquidity on Newdex and Alcor exchanges.

*As this is pre-beta, consider all elements subject to modifications*


# Proceeds
Funds will be used to pay for all end-user transactions on cXc.world, and also purchase RAM for accounts who receive our NFTs.  

Remaining Proceeds from direct listing will go towards development of cXc.world, including the final 1.0.0 release of cXc Music, and then the creation of other cXc.world mapps like cXc Video, cXc Scribe, cXc Pueblo and More.
