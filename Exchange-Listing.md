# PURPLE Exchange Listing April 17, 2021

# Overview
PURPLE's initial release starts **April 17, 2021** on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token) **You may place buy orders now.**  


Because of the very limited supply of PURPLE, ascending pricing + time-limited sell orders will be used to ensure that everyone has a chance to acquire the PURPLE they need to benefit fully from cXc.world. There are no per-account limits on purchases.  


> BLUx is also listed on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/blux-bluxbluxblux_wax-eosio.token)

# PURPLE Utility: Digital Advertising Gold
> What can you do with PURPLE?

**PURPLE** can be staked for daily Blu Ups (or [BLUX](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/blux-bluxbluxblux_wax-eosio.token)) to a piece of content; a rare form of digital advertising purchase that allows someone to buy once and hold **continual attention** for all of time. This attention means huge value, particularly to independent creators and creative organizations such as independent labels and artist collectives.

Furthermore, **PURPLE** need only be [unstaked](Everstones.md) for the holder to receive back the same amount of tokens. This means an artist can advertise their art and meanwhile hold something of increasing utility as each future cXc.world mapp is released, and future uses of PURPLE are announced.  

## Today Musicians, Tomorrow All Creators
PURPLE has a unique utility for musicians, as **cXc Music** is the first [**cXc.world**](https://cxc.world) mapp, but this utility will expand to all creators and creative collectives when **cXc Video**, **cXc Photo**, **cXc Scribe**, **cXc Art** + more mapps are available.  

# Initial Sell Orders
Starting 4/17/2021, 1/12th of the 1/12 Max Supply designated for sale will be listed with pricing starting at **20 WAX** per PURPLE.
