# PURPLE Exchange Listing April 17, 2021

# Overview
PURPLE's initial release starts **April 17, 2021** on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token) **You may place buy orders now.**  


Because of the very limited supply of PURPLE, ascending sell orders will be used to ensure that everyone has a chance to acquire the PURPLE they need to benefit fully from cXc.world. There are no per-account limits on purchases.  


> BLUx is also listed on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/blux-bluxbluxblux_wax-eosio.token)

# PURPLE Utility: Digital Advertising Gold
> What can you do with PURPLE?

**PURPLE** can be staked for daily Blu Ups (or [BLUX](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/blux-bluxbluxblux_wax-eosio.token)) to a piece of content; a rare form of digital advertising purchase that allows someone to buy once and hold **continual attention** for all of time. This attention means huge value, particularly to independent creators and creative organizations such as independent labels and artist collectives.

Furthermore, **PURPLE** need only be [unstaked](Everstones.md) for the holder to receive back the same amount of tokens. This means an artist can advertise their art and meanwhile hold something of increasing utility as each future cXc.world mapp is released, and future uses of PURPLE are announced.  

## Today Musicians, Tomorrow All Creators
PURPLE has a unique utility for musicians, as **cXc Music** is the first [**cXc.world**](https://cxc.world) mapp, but this utility will expand to all creators and creative collectives when **cXc Video**, **cXc Photo**, **cXc Scribe**, **cXc Art** + more mapps are available.  

# Initial Sell Orders
Starting 4/17/2021, 1/12th of the 1/12 Max Supply designated for sale will be listed with pricing starting at **20 WAX** per PURPLE.

# Liquidity Promise
Of the first **1,000,000 WAX** raised by the direct listing of PURPLE, no less than **500,000 WAX** will serve as liquidity on Alcor exchange and DeFi swap. PURPLE to balance this will be taken from the remaining sell orders. 


# Proceeds
WAX earned will be used to pay for all end-user transactions on cXc.world, and also purchase RAM for our records and accounts who interact with our tokens, mapps, and NFTs.  

Remaining Proceeds from the listing will go towards development of cXc.world, including the final 1.0.0 release of cXc Music, native mobile apps, and the creation of other cXc.world [mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) like cXc Video, cXc Art, cXc Ideas, cXc Pueblo and more. Funds will also pay for all other cXc operational costs, employees, promotion, events, etc. cXc will publish a running list of expenses with corresponding transactions on Github.


cXc spending transactions are inherently transparent and can be tracked here: [dplug4purple](https://wax.bloks.io/account/dplug4purple) and here [currentxchng](https://wax.bloks.io/account/currentxchng).


# Changes
On October 24, 2021, the decision was made ot list all of the sell orders at once to make the market more attractive to DeFi sites, as liquidity on both sides of the market is important when courting many buyers. We also decided to sell a small portion of PURPLE under the 20 WAX price points to reflect the much-higher current WAX price.
