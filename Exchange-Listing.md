# PURPLE Exchange Listing April 17, 2021

# Overview
PURPLE's initial release starts **April 17, 2021** on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token) and [Newdex](https://newdex.io). **You may place buy orders now.**


Because of the very limited supply of PURPLE, ascending price sell orders will be used to ensure that hoarding doesn't happen, so everyone has a chance to acquire the PURPLE they need to benefit fully from cXc.world.  


> BLUx is also listed on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/blux-bluxbluxblux_wax-eosio.token)

# Functionality: Digital Advertising Gold
> What can you do with PURPLE?

**PURPLE** can be staked for daily Ups to a piece of content; a rare form of digital advertising purchase that allows someone to buy once and hold **continual attention** for all of time. This attention means huge value, particularly to independent creators and creative organizations such as record labels and artist collectives.

Furthermore, **PURPLE** need only be unstaked for the holder to receive back the same amount of tokens. This means an artist can advertise their art and meanwhile hold something of increasing utility as each future cXc.world mapp is released.

## Today Musicians, Tomorrow All
PURPLE has a unique utility for musicians as **cXc Music** is the first [**cXc.world**](https://cxc.world) mapp, but this utility will expand to all creators and creative collectives when **cXc Video**, **cXc Photo**, **cXc Scribe**, **cXc Art** + more mapps are available.  

# First Ascending Sell Orders.
On 4/17/2021, the first 1/12th of the first sell order will be with pricing starting at **20 WAX** per PURPLE. When this clears, another sell order will be placed with base price increasing 20 WAX, and then 10 more each increasing by 20 WAX.


> Amount of Tokens Per Sell Order: 1/12 Max Supply or 12^6 (2,985,984), issued + offered 12^5 (248,832) at a time. Here's how we'll price the 12^5 tokens.

# Second, Third, and Fourth Sell Orders
Once all tokens are sold from the first orders, another 12^6 batch of 12^5 ascending sell orders will launch priced at **240 - 2880 WAX** per PURPLE. After that, a third batch will arrive priced **2880 - 34,560 WAX**, and a final sell order at **34,560 - 414,720 WAX**.

> Prices subject to change / adjust with current WAX price.

## Pricing Rationale
It's easy to see that PURPLE's later sell orders go up rapidly in price. This is to ensure:

1. Creators on cXc.world may find easier liquidity by undercutting our market orders.

3. If large players in the music industry see high utility in PURPLE and want to buy as much as they can, they will run into **exponentially scaling economic barriers** after they eat up all the creator's sell orders. This ensures no shadowy interests will get to control what content appears on the map, and if they try, they will simply be paying creators handsomely, whom will likely be able to create better content with their earnings.

> For perspective, the highest price of the final sell order equates to around 33,177 USD at current WAX rates (0.08), which would make the PURPLE market cap almost exactly the current bitcoin market cap at the current price (56,840). So although it seems astronomical, this amount has been proven to be acceptable for market valuation of a cryptocurrency.


# Liquidity Promise
Of the first **1,000,000 WAX** raised by the direct listing of PURPLE, no less than **500,000 WAX** will serve as liquidity on Newdex and Alcor exchanges and Alcor's DeFi swap.


# Founder Pay Promise
