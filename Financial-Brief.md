# 🔵 BLUx Financial Brief

## Tech
WAX token (`eosio.token` contract)  

## Utility
🔵 BLUx is a reward given to creators that receive 1 Up on a piece of content they created. Guardian and Changer roles can also earn BLUx. 

1 BLUx can be spent to make 1 Blu Up. Ups make content appear bigger on the mapp, and higher on the charts. BLUx is indivisible.

Because SOL is limited, BLUx is the only way to Up a piece of content more than 288 times on one day. 


## Max Supply = Max Possible on EOSIO (2^64-1) 🔵 BLUx

## Here's exactly how many BLUx have been issued.
1,000,000 🔵 - Promo Budget  
100,000 🔵 - Liquidity pools

We will issue up to 5,500,000 BLUx during the promotion of [cXc.world](https://cxc.world) Beta, 5,000,000 for promotion and 500,000 for liquidity. Also, we may add leftover Promo budget to liquidity pools.

Additionally, 1 BLUx is issued to be paid to artists for each Sol Up they receive  (batch pre-issued 1,000,000 at a time)
