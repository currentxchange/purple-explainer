# üîµ BLUx Financial Brief

## Utility
BLUx is a reward given to creators that receive 1 Up on a piece of content they created. Guardian and Changer roles can also earn BLUx. 

1 BLUx can be spent to make 1 Blu Up. Ups make content appear bigger on the mapp, and higher on the charts. BLUx is indivisible.

Because SOL is limited, BLUx is the only way to Up a piece of content more than 288 times on one day. 


## Max Supply = Max Possible on EOSIO (2^64-1) üîµ BLUx

## Here's exactly how many BLUx have been issued.
1,000,000 - Promo Budget
100,000 - Liquidity pools

We will issue up to 5,500,000 BLUx during the promotion of Beta, 5,000,000 for promotion and 500,000 for liquidity. Also, we may add leftover Promo budget to liquidity pools.

Additionally, 1 BLUx is issued to be paid to artists for each Sol Up they receive  (batch pre-issued 1,000,000 at a time)

**We will not issue any further BLUx until rewards systems are in place.**
