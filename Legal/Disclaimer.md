# PURPLE is not a security.
PURPLE is not a security asset. PURPLE and Current X Change LLC use the terminology used by many ICOs, cryptocurrencies and other token sales, but do not follow the investment model of other tokens that may be securities. The PURPLE token is for use only in cXc Mapps, with the opportunity to be incorporated later on by other applications. This token is integral to the utility of the application, such that the application would not be possible without it. Current X Change LLC makes no promise or suggestion that this token will make the owner’s money.

## Howey Test
Using the Howey test, we can see that PURPLE token is clearly not a security. Under the Howey Test, a transaction is an investment contract if, and only if, all of the following four conditions are met:


      1. It is an investment of money
      2. There is an expectation of profits from the investment
      3. The investment of money is in a common enterprise
      4. Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party

Here we will examine why PURPLE is not a security, and can be sold in the United States without adhering to the regulations set out for securities by the SEC. While it can be argued that some of these conditions are met, it is unreasonable to conclude that all four conditions met. The numbered points are addressed below.


1. Although money can be indirectly used to purchase PURPLE buy first purchasing WAX, it is not needed to acquire the token, nor can it be to directly acquire PURPLE. The token can be earned in through actions on cXc.world, and through actions defined by Current X Change LLC and third party applications incorporating the PURPLE Positive Attention Economy, neither of which require investment of another asset or money.

2. Documents in this repo makes it clear that the token’s value is exposure on the applications produced by Current X Change LLC and third party applications incorporating the PURPLE Positive Attention Economy. We are selling the ability to empower the creators of the world, not the return on investment in purchasing this utility token. Any person purchasing PURPLE for financial gain has created that idea through their own deduction, not through the promotional efforts of Current X Change LLC, nor any associated person or entity.

2. The Positive Attention Economy of Purple  operates completely without money. Creators can earn and spend PURPLE without ever touching money. Any financial market created for this token is separate from its function, and not needed for the operation of the token, nor for the operation of Purple.

3. Though the definition of a "common enterprise" [differs](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/159597203.pdf) in the courts, it can be argued that PURPLE does and also does not fit the common definition. While the token itself may represent a common enterprise in the sense that each token can be exchanged at market value for another currency, the actual value received for PURPLE is different for each user, most noticably in the differing incentives for Artists and Fans, but also for each individual staker, and each individual piece of content that is the recipient of these Ups.

4. The return on investment from the holding of PURPLE is stated in this repo to be the continual upvotes received on a piece of content. There is no monetary gain mentioned in this or any other Current X Change publication about Purple or PURPLE.

At no time do promoters or third parties infer the future monetary value of PURPLE or any profits associated with owning PURPLE. PURPLE’s stated value is in the utility in mapps and third party applications incorporating the Purple system, as described in this repo. That value is not guaranteed to continue, nor does Current X Change make any guarantee that cXc.world or any other services they offer be online at any time, nor that the functionality of the apps online will or won't change over time.
