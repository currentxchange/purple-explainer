# $PURPLE
[$PURPLE](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token) is the [WAX](https://wax.io/) blockchain token at the center of Purple running on cXc.world.

To learn more about the economics of cXc.world apps, see the [Purple Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2JH9J73WjgZ9-cULJAzrYvZzyPSXEA_fdgt21lHnDc/preview), and to see the first cXc.world app, cXc Music, visit [cXc.world](https://music.cxc.world)

# Supply of PURPLE

Purple has a **unchangeable maximum supply** of 12^7 (**35,831,808**) tokens, comparable with bitcoin (21,000,000) in terms of scarcity. [proof](https://wax.bloks.io/transaction/2e9499407094dbcd521f7c7b012d3a38a20fc847707a0f6e90f4e7164dd95ea5)

*There is no inflation, but burned $PURPLE may be re-minted.*


# PURPLE on cXc.world
PURPLE is given to artists that make the Top Music charts for time periods one day or greater.  

PURPLE is also supplied to the BLU / PRP **Time-Pooling Exchange**.


## Chart Rewards
Artists are **rewarded in $PURPLE for reaching the top of local and global charts.** The amount of this reward will change depending on the amount in the rewards pool. The rewards pool has a minimum size of 288 $PURPLE per day, pre-funded for the next 9+ years. [see it]()

## Time-Pooling Exchange ($BLU / $PURPLE)
Time-pools are a type of exchange independent from DEXs like Newdex and Alcor.exchange. They pool and swap ALL resources in the pools. This implies a **diminishing return**, such that the less you put in the better exchange rate you (and everyone else) gets. The exchange is funded with $PURPLE (288 PURPLE per day) by cXc + anyone else, and all $BLU is exchanged with all PURPLE. This pool is budgeted for 9+ years but **not slated for release in Beta**.


# Staking of PURPLE via NFTs

> Staking $PURPLE works differently than other tokens or DEFI liquidity tools.

Instead of a % return over time, staked $PURPLE enables periodic **Ups over time** on content on cXc Music apps.


## Without APR gains, Why would anyone stake $PURPLE??
**Content on cXc.world needs to have Ups to show up on the map**, so if music stops getting Ups, **it will disappear from the map**.

*Staking = Ups every day = Music is always on the map = Exposure*

Thus, creators who want their music to be heard have a huge **incentive for long-term staking**, as do superfans who want to help local acts become international sensations.

Staking 1 Purple will ensure a piece of content will **show up on the map and on daily charts forever**.

When a user stakes 1 or more $PURPLE, they will receive a $PURPLE-backed NFT that holds mutable information about what content they want to shine a spotlight on, and the time of day for the Up to occur.

This NFT is called an **Everstone**. *Yes, like the one you gave your [Pikachu](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Everstone).*


# Everstone NFTs
**Everstones, forged by staking $PURPLE, keep content alive on the cxc.world map forever.**

After a 24 hour wait period, the content indicated on the NFT will receive an Up from the Everstone using the Everstone's ID instead of a usual WAX account id.

Unlike BLUx Ups, Ups from Everstones are **included in the main chart rankings** used to reward content creators for appearing on the Top Charts. There is also no verification requirement to

# Everdust NFTs
Everdust is a short-term booster that gives 288 Ups over 12 hours, but costs one $PURPLE (paid into rewards pool, not staked).

**Only a small amount of Everdust is released into circulation daily.** Everdust is a fungible token, so it may be available on exchanges if none are available to purchase directly.

Everdust must be **burned** to unlock its Upping functionality, constantly lowering the supply.
