# ðŸŸ£ PURPLE
[ðŸŸ£ PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/tokens/PURPLE-wax-purplepurple) is the [WAX](https://wax.io/) blockchain token at the center of Purple and cXc.world.

# Functionality
PURPLE can be **staked for NFTs** that enable special powers, Ups, BLUX or privileges on cXc.world. PURPLE works across mapps, starting with [cXc Music](music.cXc.world). Currently, [Everstones](Everstones.md) are the only announced function of PURPLE. 

# Supply of ðŸŸ£ PURPLE
[ðŸŸ£ PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/account/purplepurple) has a [**maximum supply**](https://wax.bloks.io/transaction/2e9499407094dbcd521f7c7b012d3a38a20fc847707a0f6e90f4e7164dd95ea5) of 12<sup>7</sup> (**35,831,808**) PURPLE tokens, comparable with bitcoin (21,000,000) in terms of scarcity.

> The [circulating supply](https://wax.bloks.io/tokens/PURPLE-wax-purplepurple) of PURPLE is much smaller, currently well under one million.

*There is no inflation, but burned PURPLE may be re-issued.*


# ðŸŸ£ PURPLE on cXc.world
PURPLE is given to artists that make the [Top 64 global daily charts](Top-Charts.md).   

## Chart Rewards
Artists are **rewarded in PURPLE for reaching the top of local and global charts.** The creators fund pays 288 PURPLE per day (1 PURPLE / TU), budgeted for 1/3 Max Supply of PURPLE (11,943,936)

## Creators Fund Size in Perspective

11,943,936 PURPLE is allocated to the creators fund. The fund Rewards about 105,120 PURPLE per mapp per year (288 x 365) so this budget will last approximately 100 years for one cXc.world app, or 10 years for 10 cXc.world apps

# Staking PURPLE with Everstone NFTs

> Staking PURPLE works by attaching PURPLE to an [Everstone NFT](Everstones.md).

Instead of a % return over time, staked PURPLE enables daily **Blu Ups over time** on content on cXc Music apps. 


## The True Value of an Everstone
**Content on cXc.world needs to have Ups to show up on the map**, so if music stops getting Ups, **it will disappear from the map**.

*Staking = Ups every day = Music is always on the map = Exposure*

Thus, creators who want their music to be heard have an **incentive for long-term staking**, as do superfans who want to help local acts become international sensations.

> An everstone will ensure any one piece of content will **show up on the map and on daily charts forever**.

Everstone is an **NFT** that can hold between 1 and 288 PURPLE. Users aren't allowed to hold two identical Everstones, placing a 288 Up / content limit per account.  

This NFT is called an **Everstone**. *Yes, like the one you gave your [Pikachu](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Everstone).*


# Everstone NFTs
**Everstones, forged by staking PURPLE, keep content alive on the cxc.world map forever.**

After a 24 hour wait period, the content indicated on the NFT will receive an Up from the Everstone, represented using the Everstone's ID instead of a usual WAX account id. 

> Everstones send BLUX / Blu Ups so they are included in the default [Top Charts](Top-Charts), but not for Top 64 rewards.
