# ðŸŸ£ PURPLE
[ðŸŸ£ PURPLE](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token) is the [WAX](https://wax.io/) blockchain token at the center of Purple running on cXc.world.

# Functionality
PURPLE can be **staked for NFTs** that enable special powers or privileges on cXc.world. PURPLE works across mapps, starting with [cXc Music](music.cXc.world)

# Supply of ðŸŸ£ PURPLE
[ðŸŸ£ PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/account/dplug4purple) has an [**unchangeable maximum supply**](https://wax.bloks.io/transaction/2e9499407094dbcd521f7c7b012d3a38a20fc847707a0f6e90f4e7164dd95ea5) of 12^7 (**35,831,808**) PURPLE tokens, comparable with bitcoin (21,000,000) in terms of scarcity.

> The [circulating supply](https://wax.bloks.io/tokens/PURPLE-wax-purplepurple) of PURPLE is much smaller, currently well under one million.

*There is no inflation, but burned PURPLE may be re-minted.*


# ðŸŸ£ PURPLE on cXc.world
PURPLE is given to artists that make the Top Music charts for time periods one day or greater.  

PURPLE is also supplied to the BLU / PRP **Time-Pooling Exchange** (coming after verification).


## Chart Rewards
Artists are **rewarded in PURPLE for reaching the top of local and global charts.** The creators fund pays 288 PURPLE per day (1 PURPLE / TU), budgeted for 9+ years.

>The the reward pool is this size, not bigger, to budget for each upcoming cXc.world, roughly 1,000,000 PURPLE for each upcoming mapp.

# Staking PURPLE with Everstone NFTs

> Staking PURPLE works by attaching PURPLE to an Everstone NFT.

Instead of a % return over time, staked PURPLE enables periodic **Ups over time** on content on cXc Music apps.


## The True Value of an Everstone
**Content on cXc.world needs to have Ups to show up on the map**, so if music stops getting Ups, **it will disappear from the map**.

*Staking = Ups every day = Music is always on the map = Exposure*

Thus, creators who want their music to be heard have a huge **incentive for long-term staking**, as do superfans who want to help local acts become international sensations.

Staking 1 Purple (one daily Up) will ensure any one piece of content will **show up on the map and on daily charts forever**.

Everstone is a **PURPLE-backed NFT** that holds mutable information about what content to shine a spotlight on, and the time of day for the Up to occur. Each Everstone can hold between 1 and 288 PURPLE, and give 288 Ups per day. Users aren't allowed to hold two identical Everstones, placing a 288 Up / content limit per account.  

This NFT is called an **Everstone**. *Yes, like the one you gave your [Pikachu](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Everstone).*


# Everstone NFTs
**Everstones, forged by staking PURPLE, keep content alive on the cxc.world map forever.**

After a 24 hour wait period, the content indicated on the NFT will receive an Up from the Everstone, represented using the Everstone's ID instead of a usual WAX account id.

Unlike BLUx Ups, Ups from Everstones are **included in the main chart rankings** used to reward content creators for appearing on the Top Charts.
