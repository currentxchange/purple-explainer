# üë®‚Äçüé§ Purple Empowers Creators 

> This repo will cover cXc.world's economy, called Purple, made of the tokens [PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/account/purplepurple), [BLUX](https://wax.bloks.io/account/bluxbluxblux), and [SOL](Soldisk.md) (above), staking PURPLE with [Everstones](Everstones.md), [roadmap](Roadmap.md) and legal disclaimers. You can also browse our [tokenomic contracts](https://github.com/dougbutner/beta-pseudo).

üü£Purple is a three-token **Biomimetic Economy** where participants receive daily **SOL** to shine their light on content they love with a "Sol Up" (costs 1 SOL) that pays the content's creator a **BLUX**, which can Blu Up (costs 1 BLUX). Whoever gets the most Ups each day earns the real prize, **PURPLE**.

üó∫[cXc.world](https://cxc.world) is a music map-dapp that runs on Purple (PURPLE, BLUX, SOL). 

***So what is Purple all about?***

# üåû Solar Concept

Purple is modeled after the Solar System.

> The Sun gives us lovelight each day. If we share that lovelight with others, we grow together. If we don‚Äôt, the lovelight is unmanifested and fades away. Either way, the Sun still shines the next day, giving us another chance to share and manifest this creative solar energy.

</p>

You can claim up to 288 [SOL](Sol.md) tokens every day once you hold a [Solar Disk NFT](Solar-Disk.md), which enable you to ‚ÄúUp‚Äù creations you love on [cXc.world](https://cxc.world/), a map of music (and soon more). You can Up content **multiple times**, anytime, spending 1 SOL or BLUX per Up.  

Your **Sol Up** is burned and the creator is rewarded 1 [BLUX](Blu.md). 1 BLUX can be spent for 1 **Blu Up**, in which case the BLUX is recycled to pay creators.  

Ups (Sol Ups + Blu Ups) make content grow bigger on the map, and are counted to rank music on the [Top Charts](Top-Charts).  

Music that makes it into the **Top 64** on the daily [Top Charts](Top-Charts.md) will earn additional rewards in [PURPLE](Purple.md). 288 PURPLE is sent out every day as creator's rewards.

In addition to [swaping for WAX](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=WAX-eosio.token&input=PURPLE-purplepurple), PURPLE is the fuel for [Everstone NFTs](Everstones.md), which automatically [send 1 Blu Up or 1 BLUX every day]() to the holder, and can be upgraded with more PURPLE for higher efficiency + rewards.  


## Purple Overview
Purple works with two `eosio.token`s on [WAX](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/): **[PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/account/purplepurple)**, **[BLUX](https://wax.bloks.io/account/bluxbluxblux)**, and a [Simple Assets](https://github.com/CryptoLions/SimpleAssets) fungible token, **[SOL](https://wax.simplemarket.io/trading/ft/currentxchng/SOL)**.

> We originally planned BLU to be BLUX for verified accounts. This two-tier model has been replaced with just BLUX, and blux has been empowered in PURPLE rewards

Free daily **SOL** facilitates collaboration via Sol Ups, which pay creators 1:1 in **BLUX**. Anyone can use **BLUX** (Abundant) to Blu Up, or trade it for **PURPLE** (scarce) or WAX. **PURPLE** can be staked for ultra-rare **[Everstone NFTs](Everstones.md)**, which help creations to **shine forever** with daily Ups.

All Ups (Blu Ups, Sol Ups + Blu Ups from Everstones) are combined and counted to determine Top Charts.

> Read about Everstone NFTs in [Everstones.md](Everstones.md)  
> Read about Solar Disks in [Solar-Disk.md](Solar-Disk.md)  

Mapps (map-dapps) are **geotemporal**, and every mapp paint shows only a timespan's Upped content in a defined location. *With no Ups, it won't show up.* The latest displays only count Ups in the past day, making **[Everstones](Everstones.md)** an easy way not to disappear\*, and **Blu Ups** a shot to be seen at the top of local charts.


\* - You may also Up content manually with your daily Sol Ups

### How does a Geotemporal mapp work?
You can look at the latest trends (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, etc) or look into the past.* *Default is all-time.*

\* - Past searches work from Summer Solstice, June 2019 onward. For songs posted before Beta, all Ups are assigned to the post date of the music. In Beta, the Time Machine will function with the time of the Up, and show trends down to 5-minutes, the length of one time unit.

# cXc History
cXc.world (Alpha) launched in Dec 2018, integrated with Steemit (later Hive) with a music-to-blockchain one-click posting feature. Alpha had time-limited Ups, but not on-chain. After two minor releases (Silver Edition [2019] + Gold Version [2020]), the upcoming Beta release will enable the Purple Economy on WAX on cXc.world. We had previously announces a SMT token, but thankfully SMT tokens were never fully released by Steemit, and we all are much better off on WAX, in speed, free transactions, and community. [Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è ](https://github.com/currentxchange/purple-explainer/blob/master/Roadmap.md)

> All pre-beta Ups will be transitioned, so artists will get paid in BLUX for Ups happening now in Gold Version. 

> Note: We have temporarily removed Hive integration from cXc.world until WAX transition is complete to avoid confusion.

# Quick Definitions

**[cXc Tribe](https://cxc-world.medium.com/cxc-tribe-is-lighting-our-fire-walk-beside-us-to-a-more-musical-world-%EF%B8%8F-1dc4fdded4aa)** - Holotropic cXc Community of empowered self- and world-brightening souls.

**[cXc Tribe Temple](https://cxc-world.medium.com/tribal-temple-for-cxc-world-cxc-tribe-working-document-b92079f6927c)** - Vision, Mission, Pillars, and Foundation of everything we do.

**cXc.world** - Home of Mapps like [cXc Music](music.cxc.world)

**Mapp** - or "Map dapp" used to refer to the [mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) created by cXc using Purple

**Purple** - CoCreative, Biomimetic Economy developed by cXc

**Up** - One unit of positive vibes, like a 'like', sent by clicking a yellow or blue triangle. Manifests as a `transfer` action. Sol Ups pay the creator in BLUX, while Blu Ups cost 1 BLUX.

**Top Charts** - Content sorted by Up count, used to distribute rewards in PURPLE and determine which content should appear most prominently on the map. Top 64 content is rewarded 288 PURPLE daily. 

**Geotemporal** - Having to do with time and location, both of which are associated with a Up; the location the content was created (geo) and the Time Unit the Up happened (temporal). 

**Time Unit** - 5-minute units (288 per day) used to run cXc.world's geotemporal charts, and as the basis of Purple. 1 SOL = 1 time unit per Solar Disk-holding account, as this is the allowance of SOL cXc gives. Top Charts are calculated every time unit, with a 1 PURPLE reward, so 1 PURPLE = 1 time unit. Gregorian calander charts (Month, Week, etc.) are available, as well as down to the 5- minute time unit.

**SOL** - Abundant Time Token that can be received freely up to 288 SOL per day by any user of [mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) holding a Solar Disk. Spent 1:1 to give Sol Ups. Controlled by cXc.

**BLUX** - Abundant token distributed to recipients of Sol Ups, and for completion of Role-based tasks. Spent 1:1 to give Blu Ups, recycled to creators

**PURPLE** - Scarce token that can be staked to activate [Everstone NFTs](Everstones.md) for daily rewards, or to [Solar Disks](Solar-Disk.md)

**Everstone** - PURPLE-backed NFT that Blu Ups a specific piece of content on a mapp daily automatically [Read about Everstones](Everstones.md) or offers daily BLUX ([direct to wallet](https://wax.bloks.io/account/everpay.cxc)) of the same value. [Buy Everstones](https://nfthive.io/market?collection=currentxchng)

**Solar Disk** - NFT needed to register a user as a valid recipient of daily claimable SOL. [Learn about Solar Disks](Solar-Disk.md)

**cXc** - Short for Current X Change LLC, Maryland, USA. Name signifies Delta, the triangular symbol of change and the essence of our geotemporal curation system.
