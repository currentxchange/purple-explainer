# Purple runs on PURPLE

> This repo will cover $PURPLE, including acquiring the token, BLU, BLUx, and SOL, staking preview, and legal disclaimers.

Purple is a **Positive Attention Economy (PAE)** where participants get paid daily for sharing their opinion of what content they enjoy, and their opinion also pays creators. Purple consists of three eosio.token tokens; **$PURPLE**, **$BLU** / **$BLUx**, and **SOL**, an Atomic Assets fungible token.


Learn how Purple works by exploring the component tokens in [Purple.md](Purple.md), [Blu.md](Blu.md), [Sol.md](Sol.md).


Discover the mapps that run on Purple in the [Mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) paper.


Try the first cXc.world Mapp using Purple, **cXc Music** [music.cXc.world](https://music.cxc.world)

> cXc.world launched in Alpha in Dec 2018. After two minor releases (Silver Edition + Gold Version), the upcoming Beta release will bring Purple online starting April 17, 2021.

# Features

## Eco-Friendly

Purple lives on WAX, an EOSIO blockchain.

“EOSIO is 66,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin and 17,000 times more energy efficient than Ethereum” [GenerEOS](https://www.genereos.io/eosenergyconsumption/), 2018.

 *Nobody mines WAX!*


## No Keys to lose, No Wallet to Download
You can use [WAX Cloud Wallet](https://all-access.wax.io/) to sign up for a free custodial wallet with just your email or social login. You'll always login to your wallet with this email/social, so you don't have to worry about losing (or even storing) your private keys. Purple on cXc.world works seamlessly with WAX Cloud Wallet, and you can even pre-approve things like Ups and receiving your payments so you don't have to manually sign every transaction.

> With WAX Cloud Wallet, anyone can use blockchain and participate in the Purple economy.

If you prefer to be responsible for your private keys, any EOSIO wallet can hold your $PURPLE, $BLU and $SOL.
