# Purple Pays Creators

> This repo will cover cXc.world's biomimetic engine, Purple, made of the tokens PURPLE, BLU, BLUx, and SOL, staking PURPLE preview, and legal disclaimers.

Purple is a **Positive Attention Economy (PAE)** where participants shine their light on content they love, and that positive attention pays the creator(s).

> Above you will see Purple's gears: Sol, Blu, and PURPLE.

## Purple Overview
Purple consists of three [eosio.token](https://wax.bloks.io/account/eosio.token)s on [WAX](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/); **PURPLE**, **BLU**, and **BLUx**, and a [Simple Assets](https://github.com/CryptoLions/SimpleAssets) fungible token, **SOL**.

Free daily **SOL** enables positive attention shining via Ups, which pay creators 1:1 in **BLU**. Anyone can use **BLU** (Abundant) to Up again, or trade it for **PURPLE** (scarce) or WAX. **PURPLE** can be staked for ultra-rare **Everstone NFTs**, which help creations to **shine forever** with daily Ups.

> Read about Everstone NFTs in [Purple.md](Purple.md)

Mapps (defined below) are **geotemporal**, and every result has a timespan where Ups are counted. *No Ups, it won't show up.* The latest displays will only look at Ups in the last day, making **Everstones** an easy way to not disappear, and **BLU** Ups a shot to be seen at the top of local charts.


Learn how **Purple** works by exploring the component tokens in [Purple.md](Purple.md), [Blu.md](Blu.md), and [Sol.md](Sol.md).


Discover the dapps that we're making with Purple in the [Mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview) paper.


Try the first **cXc.world** Mapp using Purple, **cXc Music:** [music.cXc.world](https://music.cxc.world)

> cXc.world launched in Alpha in Dec 2018. After two minor releases (Silver Edition + Gold Version), the upcoming Beta release will bring Purple online starting April 17, 2021.
