# Purple Empowers Creators

> This repo will cover cXc.world's economy, called Purple, made of the tokens [PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/account/purplepurple), [BLU](https://wax.bloks.io/account/blublublublu), [BLUx](https://wax.bloks.io/account/bluxbluxblux), and [SOL](https://wax.simplemarket.io/trading/ft/currentxchng/SOL) (above), staking PURPLE preview, [roadmap](Roadmap.md) and legal disclaimers.

Purple is a **Cocreative Economy** where participants receive daily SOL to shine their light on content they love with an "Up" that pays the creator(s).

# Solar Concept

Purple is modeled after the Solar System.

> The Sun gives us love each day. If we share that love with others, we grow together. If we don’t, the love is unmanifested and fades away. Either way, the Sun still shines the next day, giving us another chance to share and manifest this loving solar energy. 

You receive 288 SOL tokens everyday, which enables you to “Up” creations you love on cXc.world, a map of music (and soon more). You can Up anything any number of times, costing 1 SOL per Up.  

Your “Sol Up” is converted and received by the creator as 1 BLUx. This is like the Rain that brings life, as 1 BLUx can be spent for 1 “Blu Up”.  

Ups (Sol Ups + Blu Ups) make content grow bigger on the map, and are combined and counted to rank music on the Top Charts.  

Content that makes it into the top 64 on the daily Top Charts will earn rewards in PURPLE, the fruit from Sun and rain.  

In addition to liquidity for WAX, 1 PURPLE can forge an Everstone NFT, which will automatically send 1 Up every day, without costing any BLUx or SOL.  

## Purple Overview
Purple works with three `eosio.token`s on [WAX](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/): **[PURPLE](https://wax.bloks.io/account/purplepurple)**, **[BLU](https://wax.bloks.io/account/blublublu)**, **[BLUx](https://wax.bloks.io/account/bluxbluxblux)**, and a [Simple Assets](https://github.com/CryptoLions/SimpleAssets) fungible token, **[SOL](https://wax.simplemarket.io/trading/ft/currentxchng/SOL)**.

Free daily **SOL** facilitates collaboration via Sol Ups, which pay creators 1:1 in **BLU**/**BLUx**. Anyone can use **BLU**/**BLUx** (Abundant) to Blu Up, or trade it for **PURPLE** (scarce) or WAX. **PURPLE** can be staked for ultra-rare **Everstone NFTs**, which help creations to **shine forever** with daily Ups.

All Ups (Blu, Sol + Everstone) are combined and counted to determine Top Charts.

> Read about Everstone NFTs in [Purple.md](Purple.md)

Mapps (defined below) are **geotemporal**, and every result has a timespan where Ups are counted. *With no Ups, it won't show up.* The latest displays only count Ups in the past day, making **Everstones** an easy way not to disappear, and **BLU** Ups a shot to be seen at the top of local charts.

### How does a Geotemporal mapp work?
You can look at the latest trends (Weekly, Daily, hourly, etc) or look into the past*. *Default is all-time.*

# Quick Definitions

**cXc.world** - Home of Mapps, like cXc Music (music.cXc.world) the first Mapp

**Mapp** - Mapping application, or "Map dapp" used to refer to the mapps created by cXc using Purple

**Purple** - CoCreative Economy developed by cXc

**Up** - Signifies love and support of content. Comes as Sol Up or Blu Up. 

**Top Charts** - Content sorted by Up count on a mapp, used to distribute rewards in PURPLE and determine which content should appear most prominently on the map. Top 64 content is rewarded daily. 

**Time Unit** - 5-minute units used to run cXc geotemporal displays. 1 SOL signifies 1 time unit. Top Charts are calculated every time unit. Gregorian time spans (Month, Week, etc.) are calculated from aggregating time unit information and are used in Mapps to give rewards (ex. daily Top Chart rewards = 288 time units = 288 PURPLE).

**SOL** - Abundant Time-Token that can be received freely up to 288 SOL per day by any user of [mapps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YppJ2EYumRI2j0UHYdZh7NJMObMI_NfHgaFRLbjgBtw/preview). Spent 1:1 to give Sol Ups

**BLU** - Abundant token distributed to recipients of Sol Ups, and for completion of Role-based tasks. Burnt 1:1 to give Blu Ups

**PURPLE** - Scarce token that can be staked for Everstones

**Everstone** - PURPLE-backed NFT that Ups a specific piece of content on a mapp periodically automatically

**Solar Disk** - NFT needed to register a user as a valid recipient of SOL, and hold SOL.
